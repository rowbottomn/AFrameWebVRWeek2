          There is a large amount of things we can do and directions we can go with WebVR.  I actualkly had a hard time narrowing it down. I will probably continue to work with this as I go forward and may stick with it depending on the limitations I see with the AFrame library and support.
          The lack of javascript in this course does hamper us but even so here are the list of topics we will explore this week.
          <ol>
            <li>Building a character out of basic shapes.</li>
            <div class="img_holder">
              <img class = "centered_img" src="/assets/images/PiggyExample.png">
            </div>
            <li>Building a scene and adding in assets and models to make a late Mother's Day Sketch</li>
            <div class="img_holder">
              <img class = "centered_img" src="/assets/images/2-2objective.png">
            </div>
            <li>Adding animations and interactions</li>
            <div class="img_holder">
              <img class = "centered_img" src="/assets/images//2-3objective.png">
            </div>

          </ol>

          This week is a longer week in terms of video length.  But I know you can do it and I hope the topics are interesting enough to keep you going forward.
