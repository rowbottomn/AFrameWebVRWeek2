          I want to show you how to access a huge amount of tools that programmers that worked on this Aframe project made for it.  They allow you to make incredible things in AFrame without much or any actual coding. <br>
        
          <a href = "https://aframe.io/aframe-registry/">Go to this site to find the AFRAME Tool Registry.</a>

          The three special topics I wanted to cover was preset environments, animations and particle effects.  I actually have several things but things were not working out. So we will cover animations and environments.

        <br>
        Start a repl and follow along with the video lesson below. I would encourage you to play with the toys.  I can and want to answer questions about these libraries.  Next week I will make an assignment that is fun and uses them.  I was thinking of something that uses interactions.<br>

        You will need the below code.
